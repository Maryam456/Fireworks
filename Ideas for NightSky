instead of cricles put stars
Include an edge detection to get 100% same thing
add a limit to how many circles can go on board
make sure stars don't overlap
continue off Mercers basic algorithm 
the moving ball with addtional speed and many ball algorithm  all together (edge detection and overlap)
for everytime mouseclicked, approximately 30 stars shift to a random height and width
try to create a loop where 30 stars can appear
100 stars
10 000 stars 
until they fill up the screen 

only use the main program 
include star.java
don't use screenSizeChecker
build another constructor
have your createStars
